        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In this assignment, I implement cloth simulation along with some shaders. For the cloth simulation part, I model a cloth as a grid of springs and masses and apply forces according to the laws of physics. Additional features with my cloth simulation include self-collisions, collisions with spheres, and collisions with planes. For the shader part, I apply various types of shaders to modify the appearance of a model. These shaders include Blinn-Phong shaders, bump maps, displacement maps, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            I found this assignment very eye-opening as it sort of reveals to us the underlying mechanics of simulations in graphics. Before this assignment, cloth simulation seemed like much of a mystery to me that appeared complicated to implement, when in reality you can easily model it using just a grid of springs and masses. I also had a similar sentiment with shaders, but I learned that with the correct math and calculations, you can also easily implement seemingly-complex shaders.
        </p>

        </b>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        In this part, I build a grid of springs and masses to support cloth simulation. In terms of graphics and simulation, a cloth can be represented as a bunch of point masses, each connected to one another using springs which represent different constraints. For this assignment, I created springs between point masses for structural, shearing, and bending constraints. Structural constraints were applied for points to the direct left and above a point mass. Bending constraints were applied for points that were 2 away to the left and above. Shearing constraints were applied for points that were diagonally upwards from a point mass (up and to the left, and up and to the right). At this point, I also set relevant point masses to be “pinned” (using an input list of pinned point masses).

    </a>
    <p>
        In this part, I implement cloth simulation by taking into account external and spring forces.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <b>
            Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation.
            To do so, pause the simulation at the start with <kbd>P</kbd>, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing <kbd>P</kbd> again.
            You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing <kbd>R</kbd>.

            </small>
        </b>

    </blockquote>

    <p>
        When I decrease the spring constant ks, the cloth acts more springy and loose, as if the cloth is thinner. When I increase ks, the cloth acts more stiff and seems to bounce less as it reaches its resting point. Creasing at the resting point also appears different; with a higher ks, there are fewer and bigger creases across the cloth, but with a lower ks, there are more small, localized creases.

    <p>
        When I decrease density, the cloth appears more light as it falls. The creasing at its resting point becomes much less apparent. On the other hand, when I increase density, the cloth appears heavier and there is more creasing. At the end of the simulation, the middle of the cloth sags even more, as if there is a heavy weight.

    </blockquote>

    <p>
        When I decrease damping, the cloth takes a longer time to reach its resting state and bounces around more. There also seems to be micro wavy/oscillating movements along the cloth itself. When I increase damping, the cloth bounces much less, and there are little to no movements within the cloth itself. It also takes a longer time to reach a resting state, but not in the same way as before: the cloth falls as if it is a very light piece of paper, or that it is under low gravity.

        <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
        In this part, I apply collisions, specifically between cloth and sphere and cloth and plane. Below are screenshots of collisions with the sphere. To implement this, I check for each point mass in the cloth is within a collision object at each time step. For a sphere, this would be checking whether or not the position of the point mass is within the sphere. I use the equation of a sphere and check the condition ((x1 - x0)^2 + (y1 - y0)^2 + (z1 - z0)^2 <= r^2). For a plane, this would be checking whether or not it passes the plane from one side to the other, between pm.position and pm.last_position. In code, I take dot products on vectors originating from the given point on the plane and check if their signs are the same or different (different signs means that the point passed through the plane). Specifically, I take the dot(pm.position - point, normal - point) and dot(pm.last_position - point, normal - point) and compare their sign values.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the point does indeed pass through or into the collision object, I compute where the point mass should have landed instead (either on the surface of the sphere or right above the plane with an offset distance). With this corrected point, I compute a correction vector that I add to pm.position, scaled by (1 - friction) to account for friction between the cloth and the object.

    <p>
        As the spring constant ks increases, the cloth appears stiffer. When it lands on the sphere, the cloth appears to be more thick as it does not seem to fully wrap itself around the top of the sphere. On the other hand, when ks decreases, the cloth seems to become ‘thinner’ and wraps more easily around the sphere, allowing us to more clearly see the shape of the sphere lying underneath the cloth. At the resting state, a bigger ks results in a cloth with fewer big creases, while a smaller ks results in a cloth with more small creases.

This makes sense because the cloth is technically heavier. When I decrease density, the cloth seems crumple less at the bottom when it falls; any folds that it has while falling is more spread out throughout the cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
        The spring constant ks also seems to affect the way that the cloth falls. When I increase the ks, the cloth is stiffer and it crumples less while falling. Its resting state has fewer folds and crinkles. When I decrease the ks, the cloth folds a lot at the bottom, and the folds are not as uniformly distributed. The cloth appears to retain small crinkles more easily.

    <p>
        A shader program is a program separate from raytracing that allows us to simulate different textures and materials on objects in the graphics pipeline. They run parallel on the GPU and can translate input into one 4D vector output to describe the RGBA of one coordinate/position.
    </p>
    <p>
        For OpenGL, 2 shader types work together to create lighting and material effects. The vertex shaders first modify the normal and position vectors of a vertex. This is especially relevant for displacement maps. The fragment shaders process fragments (which are like samples) that are outputted after rasterization. These shaders take in the geometric attributes/inputs of the fragment (calculated from the vertex shader) and return one output vector that represents the color of the vertex or pixel.

    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The Blinn-Phong shading model is a type of shading that takes in three components of lighting: ambient (helps fill in black shadows), specular (for reflection spots and ‘shininess’), and diffuse (base color of object). These three components are calculated separately and added together to compute the final reflected light value.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Blinn-Phong shading model has a couple of parameters that we can tweak to get the desired look on a model. Each of the three components has a constant that when increased, increases its impact on the overall look of the model (i.e. a high specular coefficient results in a very shiny/metallic-looking object). Also, the specular component has an additional p parameter that, when increased, narrows the reflection lobe of the object.

    <p>
        In addition to Blinn-Phong shading, I also implement texture mapping, as well as bump and displacement maps. Bump mapping and displacement mapping are different in that displacement mapping geometrically modifies the vertex positions based on the map heights, while bump mapping leaves the vertex positions and normals untouched. The difference can be seen in the images below, where the outline of the cloth and sphere in bump mapping remains round/smooth while the outline in displacement mapping appears more jagged.

    <p>
        Bump and displacement maps also react differently to changes in the sphere mesh’s coarseness. When I increase the resolution of the model, the effects of the displacement map become more pronounced, crisp, and accurate. The effects of the bump map appear to remain the same. This seems to make sense as bump maps do not modify the vertices’ geometric properties.
